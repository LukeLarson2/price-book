To run the Price Book App on your local machine, do the following:

1. Download the enitre Price Book source code form this git hub (Both front and backend folders)
2. Open the root folder "price-book" in Visual Studio
3. In visual studio, open two command terminals and navigate to the "frontend" directory in one and the "backend" directory in the other
4. In both directorys execute ```npm install``` and wait for all dependencies to install
5. In the "backend" root folder create a new file and name it ".env"
6. Within the .env file add two environment variables, the first will contain the MongoDB URI link with your login credentials stored in a variable named DB_URI and the second will be the default port set to 4000 store in a variable named PORT. It should look something like this:

DB_URI=YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE
PORT=4000

7. Save the file
8. Execute ```npm start``` in both directories
